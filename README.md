# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Technologies Used 
* Future Features

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.


**BEM**

In this Project I've used all my knowledge about BEM and the methodology of naming files, directorys naming and file structure.

**Display: Grid, Display: Flex**

At the entirety of the project you can find Grid tabels and Flex elements.

**What lies ahead**

In the future I plan to make the site reactive and make it possible to change the language between English and Spanish.
